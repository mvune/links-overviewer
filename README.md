# Links Overviewer

Links Overviewer is a browser extension that creates a slick overview of user 
selected links.

## How does it work?

Quite simple. Just select the text that contains the links you want an overview 
of. Press right mouse button and in the context menu that pops up, click "Show 
selected link(s) in links overview". The overview will now be opened in a new tab.

## Where/how to download/install?

Currently this extension is not available for download from any browser store.

You could however clone or download it from here, get it zipped and try to install 
it manually. Mind though that the extension has to be signed first.
