# Links Overviewer

Links Overviewer is a browser extension that creates a slick overview of user 
selected links.

## How it works

Quite simple. Just select the text that contains the links you want an overview 
of. Press right mouse button and in the context menu that pops up, click "Show 
selected link(s) in links overview". The overview will now be opened in a new tab.
